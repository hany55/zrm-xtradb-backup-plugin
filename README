Synopsis
--------
This plugin can be used with mysql-zrm when running mysql-zrm on the same
server that the mysql DB is running on.

Installing
----------

1) Copy xtradb-backup.pl to your mysql-zrm plugins directory. This should
   be /usr/share/mysql-zrm/plugins on standard RedHat and derivative 
   distributions.

2) Add the following line to your mysql-zrm.conf file:

   ihb-plugin=/usr/share/mysql-zrm/plugins/xtradb-backup.pl

   This should reflect the path to the xtradb-backup.pl file you pulled from
   our github repository.

3) Make sure the backup-mode is not set to logical in your mysql-zrm.conf. The
   default is raw.

4) The default settings written in to the plugin will get you going. If you want 
   to modify the behaviour of the xtrabackup plugin, then proceed to adjust the 
   features explained in the Configuring section.

Configuring
-----------
All options below are specified with the default value the plugin runs with
and {possible values} in curly braces. You do not need to define any of these
in the mysql-zrm.conf unless you want to change the default values.

xdb-save-mycnf=1 {0,1}: This option saves a copy of all
	mysql variables that are currently set in a my.cnf format. This
	is so that if a restore is needed after a change has been made
	the appropriate options are backed up.

xdb-double-prepare=0 {0,1}: This option tells percona's xtrabackup
	to not only back the data up and run one prepare to make the
	database useable, but to run prepare a second time. This
	regenerates the innodb logs so you can plop the backup in to
	production right away on restore. Remember, doing this will take
	a significant amount of space depending on how big your log files
	are.

xdb-copy-frm=1 {0,1}: This option copies all the support files that are
	necessary to use the innodb backups properly. It includes all the
	.frm files and .opt files. This option should basically always be
	on for consistent backups.

xdb-throttle=<none> {int}: This option is simply passed on to xtrabackup.
	It allows you throttle the xtrabackup procedure by specifying
	the number of pairs of read-and-write operations per second that
	xtrabackup will perform.
	
xdb-use-memory=<none> {int}: This option is simply passed on to xtrabackup.
	This option affects how much memory is allocated for preparing a 
	backup with --prepare, or analyzing statistics with --stats. The
	xtrabackup default is 100MB.

xdb-parallel=<none> {int}: This option is simply passed on to xtrabackup.
	This option specifies the number of threads to use to copy multiple 
	data files concurrently when creating a backup. The xtrabackup default
	is 1 (no concurrent transfer).

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
* If you have a database that contains a mix of tables with different 
  database engines, mysql-zrm will not beahve properly when using this plugin. You
  risk missing tables in your backups. This is not an issue if your database tables
  were created consistenly. This does not affect you if you have a strict MYISAM database
  and a databse that is strict INNODB. This plugin and mysql-zrm will perform as expected.

* You will have to restore your backup manually using xtrabackup.

TODO
----
- Add restore functionality for turnkey hotbackup support.
