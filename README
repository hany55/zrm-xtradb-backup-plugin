Installing
----------
Add the following line to your mysql-zrm.conf file:

ihb-plugin=/usr/share/mysql-zrm/plugins/xtradb-backup.pl

Then proceed to adjust the features explained in the Configuring section.

Configuring
-----------
All options are defined in the mysql-zrm.conf file in your /etc directory.
All options are specified with their default value.


xdb-save-mycnf=1 {0,1}: This option saves a copy of all
	mysql variables that are currently set in a my.cnf format. This
	is so that if a restore is needed after a change has been made
	the appropriate options are backed up.

xdb-double-prepare=0 {0,1}: This option tells percona's xtrabackup
	to not only back the data up and run one prepare to make the
	database useable, but to run prepare a second time. This
	regenerates the innodb logs so you can plop the backup in to
	production right away on restore. Remember, doing this will take
	a significant amount of space depending on how big your log files
	are.

xdb-copy-frm=1 {0,1}: This option copies all the support files that are
	necessary to use the innodb backups properly. It includes all the
	.frm files and .opt files. This option should basically always be
	on for consistent backups.

xdb-throttle=<none> {int}: This option is simply passed on to xtrabackup.
	It allows you throttle the xtrabackup procedure by specifying
	the number of pairs of read-and-write operations per second that
	xtrabackup will perform.
	
xdb-use-memory=<none> {int}: This option is simply passed on to xtrabackup.
	This option affects how much memory is allocated for preparing a 
	backup with --prepare, or analyzing statistics with --stats. The
	xtrabackup default is 100MB.

xdb-parallel=<none> {int}: This option is simply passed on to xtrabackup.
	This option specifies the number of threads to use to copy multiple 
	data files concurrently when creating a backup. The xtrabackup default
	is 1 (no concurrent transfer).
